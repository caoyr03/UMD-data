## Project Name

Urban Ministries of Durham Data Exploration

## Dataset

The dataset was provided by UMD services which assist 6,000 homeless people each year with food, shelter, clothing and/or supportive services. Basic features included in the dataset are: family identifier(single or family), bus tickets, food provided for(# of people), food pound, clothing, diapers, school kits, hygiene kits, and financial support. 

## Research Question

The primary question is how the resources provided by UMD have changed with time. Correlation problem such as whether clothing has positive relationship with family identity could also be considered.

## Research Variable

I will work on the variables of family identifier, food provided ratio/person, and clothing.

## Method

ggplot, tidyverse will be used to visualize the dataset and preview the relationship between variables in dataset.
