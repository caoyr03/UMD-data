Overall, you have done a really great job! 
Your correlation plot is very interesting to read.  Exploring staying time with
other attributes about the population is also a good point. 
You clearly communicated your purpose of analysis in your readme and script file.
I could easily follow your analysis along your Python and R script file with the 
help of your comment and plots. I appreciate how your code and plot are closely
interacted. It would also be great if you could add some comments about findings
to each of your analysis instead of simply printing out the head of the datatable.

One thing you could improve later on is to use Make and Docker file to organize
your workflow of project. It not only help users to run your whole project at 
a time, it could also serve as an ideal interpreter of what role each file is
playing in general. Otherwise, you could add some explanation in your readme
with illustration what you did in each R and Python file and what output could 
be expected inside. If taking further, you could even insert your saved plot 
image into your readme 'Result' section to show a full cycle of project.

I appreciate your hardwork and amazing project! Thanks!
