score: 15/15

I truly appreciate your feedback! I took the easy way in data wrangling by simply
removing the missing data. I was not not sure dates are relevant to my other research
questions so I did not them (and time constraints also limited the extensiveness of my analysis).
But this could be something to explore in future analysis.
